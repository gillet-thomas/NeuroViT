fmri2vec is an **fMRI encoder** leveraging **Transformer and Vision Transformer (ViT)** architectures to process and encode the fMRI data directly **in 4D**.
**G3DViT**, a 3D Grad-CAM, has been integrated to provide insights into the model's decision-making process and enhance interpretability.

# Objective
This project is a subpart of a bigger research and development project focused on creating a **multimodal** model for medical image computing. The primary goal of that project is to integrate fMRIs, behavioral data, and blood-based markers into a joint embedding space. This common representation will then be used to classify patients based on **their pain sensitivity threshold.**

This R&D project aims to advance the field of medical image computing by offering a novel approach to **patient classification based on pain sensitivity,** utilizing the power of multimodal data integration and state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
